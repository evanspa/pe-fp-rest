# pe-fp-rest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanspa/pe-fp-rest.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/evanspa/pe-fp-rest)

A Clojure library providing REST API functionality for the fuel purchase system.

pe-fp-rest exposes the functionality of
[pe-fp-core](https://github.com/evanspa/pe-fp-core) as a REST API using
[Liberator](http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/).

## About the Fuel Purchase System

The fuel purchase system provides the ability to record and analyze your
vehicle's fuel usage.  It currently consists of an iOS (iPhone) application, as
well as a server-side REST application (*which the iOS app communicates with*).
In its present form, the fuel purchase system is not terribly useful.  It
enables you to collect fuel usage statistics with respect to your vehicles, but
none of the analysis / reporting functionality is built out yet.

### Client Applications

Currently there only exists an iOS application for the fuel purchase system: [PEFuelPurchase-App](https://github.com/evanspa/PEFuelPurchase-App).

### Server Application

The server-side REST application is implemented using Clojure: [pe-fp-app](https://github.com/evanspa/pe-fp-app).  This repository, *pe-fp-rest*, is used by it.

pe-fp-rest makes use of the [pe-* Clojure library suite](#pe--clojure-library-suite).

## Documentation

## Installation

pe-fp-rest is available from Clojars.  Add the following dependency to your
`project.clj` file:
